# Wikipedia-Table-Scrapping
Choose a table on a web page (use your discretion) and scrape the contents to a csv file.
The table selected must have at least 3 numerical columns and at least 15 rows.
You must produce the following results for at least 2 of those columns:
● count - number of values in the column
● mean - average of all values in the column
● std - standard deviation of the column
● min - minimum value in the column
● 25% - percentile value in the column
● 50% - percentile value in the column
● 75% - percentile value in the column
● max - maximum value in the column
Deliverables:
- A file containing your python code. I would prefer an ipynb file, but the choice is yours.
- The csv file
- The aforementioned results
